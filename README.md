# Redline Parts

This repository contains example front-end code for a demo car parts website. The `website/` folder holds an HTML/CSS/JS project that can be served as a static site.

## Running locally

Open `website/index.html` in a modern browser to view the site. No additional build steps are required. If you prefer to serve the files locally, run `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

To run lint checks, install dependencies with `npm install` and then run `npm test`.
